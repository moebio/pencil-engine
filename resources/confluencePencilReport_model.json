      "answer": "answer:\nStudying this topic is relevant because it addresses a critical gap in understanding how gene dosage differences at the expression level influence tumorigenesis. Activating oncogenic mutations can arise from a gain of a single mutant allele—a change that occurs in approximately half of all oncogenic driver mutations and is sufficient to trigger tumorigenesis, thereby potentially dictating prognosis and therapeutic sensitivity (1). Additionally, normal cis‐regulatory variation affects most of the human genome and underpins a significant portion of phenotypic diversity (3–5). Given that such regulatory mechanisms have been linked to disease risk in breast tissue (8–11) but their influence on the clinical impact of oncogenic mutations remains largely unexplored, investigating how cis‐regulatory variation modulates the penetrance of mutations (as in the case of PIK3CA) is crucial for improving our mechanistic understanding and clinical management of cancer.",

For breast tumor samples, we conducted a mutant versus wild‐type allelic expression analysis using DNA-seq and RNA-seq data from two independent datasets (METABRIC, n=94; TCGA, n=178). For each tumor, we calculated three allelic ratios: (1) α – the log2 ratio of mutant to wild‐type RNA-seq reads reflecting net mutant allele expression imbalance; (2) β – the log2 ratio of mutant to wild‐type DNA-seq reads representing relative copy number; and (3) γ – defined as α minus β to isolate the contribution of cis‐regulatory variation.

In breast tumors, net mutant allele expression imbalances were common, occurring in 70.2% of METABRIC samples and 60.1% of TCGA samples, with striking mutant allele fold differences (up to 44.8-fold in METABRIC and 220-fold in TCGA) as opposed to much smaller differences for the wild-type allele (Fig. 2b). Moreover, cis‐regulatory effects—quantified via the γ ratio—accounted for imbalances in 27.7% of METABRIC and 11.8% of TCGA tumors and explained 20.6% and 14.4% of the variance in mutant allele expression, respectively (Supplementary Table 5). Finally, tumors that preferentially expressed the mutant allele (the γmut group) were significantly associated with poorer disease‐specific survival (median overall survival of 5.88 versus 12.46 years; P = 0.031; Fig. 3a) and with adverse clinicopathological features such as ER-negative, PR-negative, and HER2-positive status (Fig. 3b).",

      "answer": "answer:\nFinding 1:\nOur study demonstrates that allelic expression imbalance between the mutant and wild‐type alleles of PIK3CA is common in breast cancer and holds prognostic value. \n\nContext 1:\nThe manuscript places this finding within the broader literature by noting that, given PIK3CA’s role as an oncogene, the preferential expression of the mutant allele may reflect positive selection processes. This is reinforced by analyses of RNA‐seq data from two independent cohorts (METABRIC and TCGA), and the result is further contextualized by its association with adverse clinical parameters (ER‐negative, PR‐negative, and HER2‐positive statuses20,21) as well as worse overall and disease‐specific survival in the METABRIC dataset. Additional prior work (e.g., the observation that genomic PIK3CA mutations lack clear prognostic value22,23) further emphasizes the novelty of evaluating expression levels.\n\nInterpretation 1:\nThese results suggest that transcript‐level analysis of PIK3CA mutations can reveal clinically relevant heterogeneity. The preferential expression of the mutant allele may indicate a more aggressive tumor phenotype and implies that incorporating allelic expression assessment into diagnostic protocols could improve patient stratification and therapeutic decisions.\n\nFinding 2:\nThe study quantifies the contribution of cis‐regulatory variation, showing that it explains approximately 16% of the variability observed in net allelic expression in tumors.\n\nContext 2:\nThis finding is discussed in relation to prior studies on normal cis‐regulatory variation, including the evaluation of the rs2699887 variant—which has been linked to poor prognosis in other cancers (30,31) though with some contradictory reports (32,33). Moreover, the observed greater allelic imbalance in tumors compared to normal-matched tissue, alongside supportive data from independent cohorts, situates this result within the current understanding of somatic regulatory mutations.\n\nInterpretation 2:\nThe data indicate that, besides genomic allelic dosage, cis‐regulatory mechanisms significantly modulate mutation penetrance and expression. This implies that noncoding regulatory variations might contribute to tumor evolution and progression and that future therapeutic strategies should consider the combined effects of coding and cis‐regulatory mutations.",

      "answer": "answer:\nFigure 1 shows that cis‐regulatory variation in normal breast tissue leads to differential allelic expression of six PIK3CA variants—most displaying a unilateral expression pattern and one variant (rs3729679) standing out by not being in strong LD.  \nFigure 2a illustrates the conceptual framework that cis‐regulatory modulation can drive preferential expression of gain‐of‐function PIK3CA mutations, thereby contributing to intertumor clinical heterogeneity.  \nFigure 2b demonstrates that net mutant allele expression imbalances (α ratios) are frequent in breast tumors (70.2% in METABRIC and 60.1% in TCGA) and that cis‐regulatory effects (γ ratios) are also common (27.7% in METABRIC and 11.8% in TCGA).  \nFigure 2c shows that net mutant allele expression correlates positively with both copy number variation (r² = 0.80) and cis‐regulatory variation (r² = 0.34), with the copy number effect being more marked.  \nFigure 2d reveals that a majority of tumors preferentially express the mutant allele despite its lower genomic copy number, highlighting the influence of cis‐regulatory mechanisms.  \nFigure 3a establishes that tumors with preferential mutant allele expression (γmut) have significantly poorer disease‐specific survival—with median overall survival of 5.88 years versus 12.46 years for balanced expression tumors.  \nFigure 3b demonstrates that preferential mutant allele expression is significantly associated with adverse prognostic markers, being higher in ER‐negative, PR‐negative, and (in METABRIC) HER2‐positive tumors.",

      "answer": "answer:\nIn normal breast tissue, we found that six cis‐regulatory variants (daeSNPs) affect PIK3CA expression—with rs3960984 showing differential allelic expression in 57% of heterozygotes (Fig. 1, Supplementary Table 1) and rs2699887 emerging as a candidate regulatory SNP (nominal P value ≤0.05; Supplementary Fig. 1A–E). In breast tumors, net mutant allele expression imbalances (α ratios) were evident in 70.2% of METABRIC samples (66/94) and 60.1% of TCGA samples (107/178), with mutant alleles being overexpressed up to 44.8-fold in METABRIC and 220-fold in TCGA compared to wild-type alleles (5.4-fold and 29-fold, respectively; Fig. 2b), while cis‐regulatory effects (γ ratios) revealed preferential mutant expression in 27.7% and 11.8% of tumors, corresponding to 10- and 4.2-fold differences and accounting for 20.6% (METABRIC) and 14.4% (TCGA) of expression variance (Supplementary Table 5). Additionally, net allelic expression correlated strongly with copy number (r² = 0.80) relative to cis‐regulatory variation (r² = 0.34), with most tumors showing positive γ and negative β values (70.2% in METABRIC, 54.5% in TCGA; Fig. 2c–d) and a subset (10.6% and 11.2%) overexpressing the mutant allele despite lower copy number. Finally, clinical analysis showed that tumors with preferential mutant allele expression (γ_mut group) had significantly poorer disease‐specific survival (median overall survival 5.88 vs. 12.46 years, P = 0.031; Fig. 3a) and were associated with adverse prognostic markers (ER-negative, PR-negative, and HER2-positive; Fig. 3b), with γ ratios also correlating with lower PR expression (P = 0.040), HER2 positivity (P = 0.025), and PAM50 subtype (q = 0.027 in METABRIC).",

      "section_content": "Activating oncogenic mutations are often characterized by gain-of-function single-base alterations or focal DNA copy-number ampliﬁcation, where the gain of just a single copy of a mutant allele is sufﬁcient for tumorigenesis1. These gains change the stoichiometric balance between mutant and wild-type alleles and are selected for in cancers, affecting approximately half of all oncogenic driver mutations1. Ultimately, they could dictate prognosis and therapeutic sensitivity. However, the impact of gene dosage differences of oncogenic mutations generated at the gene expression level has been largely unexplored. Genetic variation and mutations regulate gene expression in an allele-speciﬁc manner—known as cis-regulatory variation2—by altering protein and miRNA binding, for example.\n\nNormal cis-regulatory variation affects most of the human genome in all tissues and generates the wealth of phenotypic variation seen in species3–5. Moreover, an extensive contribution\n\nfrom noncoding variants to RNA alterations was recently observed in tumors6, including allelic imbalance of somatic mutations7.\n\nNevertheless, one unsolved aspect is how much each mechanism contributes to generating allelic imbalances in expression and whether they do it independently or in synergy. In breast tissue, germline regulatory variation is associated with disease risk8 and affects frequently mutated genes9. We and others have shown that variants affecting the expression levels of BRCA1 and BRCA2 modify the risk of breast cancer in germline mutation carriers10,11.\n\nWe found that carriers of germline nonsense mutations in the tumor suppressor gene BRCA2 were at a lower risk of developing breast cancer when the remaining wild-type allele was highly\n\nexpressed11.\n\nHere, we hypothesize that cis-regulatory variation also modulates the penetrance of oncogenic coding mutations. In the context of a gene cis-regulated by a genetic variant generating\n\nimbalanced allelic expression, we postulate that an oncogenic activating mutation in the same gene will have a different clinical impact depending upon whether it occurs in the preferentially\n\nexpressed allele or the less expressed one. We tested this model in the context of heterozygous mutations in PIK3CA, the most frequently mutated gene in breast cancer. First, we investigated\n\nwhether normal cis-regulatory variation regulated the expression of PIK3CA in normal breast tissue. Then, we calculated allelic expression ratios between mutant and wild-type copies in tumors\n\nfrom two large breast cancer datasets—METABRIC and TCGA— both normalized for DNA copy number or not. Finally, we correlated the allelic expression ratios with clinical data. This\n\napproach allows us to distinguish between expression imbalances generated from cis-regulatory variation alone, altered DNA copy number, or both mechanisms.",

      "section_content": "Normal cis-regulatory variation affects PIK3CA expression in healthy breast tissue\n\nTo investigate whether cis-regulatory variation modulates the expression of PIK3CA in normal breast tissue, we analyzed data from previous allelic expression analysis of normal breast tissue from 64 healthy donors12. We calculated the ratio of expression of one allele by the other in heterozygous variant positions, which is\n\na robust approach to detect cis-acting variant effects, as it cancels\n\nout the trans effects that act on the same gene and inﬂuence both\n\nalleles equally. We found six variants in PIK3CA displaying\n\ndifferential allelic expression (daeSNPs) (see “Methods”) (Fig. 1).\n\nOf these six, only rs3729679 is not in strong linkage\ndisequilibrium (LD) with the others (Supplementary Table 1).\n\nrs3960984 showed the largest proportion of heterozygotes\ndisplaying allelic differences (57%), while three other daeSNPs\n\nshared the smallest fraction (14%): rs12488074, rs4855093,\n\nand rs9838411.\n\nIn the daeSNPs rs7636454, rs3960984, rs12488074, and\n\nrs9838411, the ratios showed a unilateral distribution, with\n\nsamples displaying preferential expression towards the same\n\nallele. These patterns of allelic expression ratios’ distribution\n\nsuggest that the daeSNPs at which allelic expression is being\n\nmeasured and the possible functional regulatory variants (rSNPs)\n\nare in strong, yet incomplete, LD with each other13.\n\nWhile the mapping analysis carried out to identify candidate\n\nrSNPs did not ﬁnd a signiﬁcant association after multiple testing\n\ncorrection (Supplementary Table 2), one of the variants with\n\nnominal P value ≤0.05, rs2699887 (Wilcoxon two-sample test\n\nestimated difference of 0.22, 95% CI =[0.031-Inf]) (Supplementary\n\nFig. 1A), showed great regulatory potential. Namely, it is an eQTL\n\n(expression quantitative trait locus) for PIK3CA (P =0.011, Supple-\n\nmentary Fig. 1B) in tumors from METABRIC14, is located at its\n\npromotor region and at a DNAse I hypersensitivity site (Supple-\n\nmentary Fig. 1C), and is bound by POL2 in a breast cancer cell line\n\n(Supplementary Table 3). In-silico functional analysis of this variant\n\nsuggested a disruption of the binding motif of the transcription\n\nfactor NF-YA (Supplementary Fig. 1D), and in vitro studies revealed\n\na preferential protein::DNA binding to the minor T allele of rs2699887, which is associated with higher expression of PIK3CA\n\nin tumors (Supplementary Fig. 1E).\n\n\nPreferential expression of the PIK3CA mutated alleles is\n\nfrequent in breast tumors\n\nChanges in DNA copy number in tumors are associated with\n\nchanges in gene expression in cis1,14–17 leading to dosage\n\nimbalances of coding mutations7. However, these differences\n\ncan also be due to germline and somatic cis-regulatory variation,\n\nbut their effect on mutation dosage imbalance is underexplored.\n\nSo, we set out to assess whether PIK3CA somatic mutations would\n\nhave their functional effects, or penetrance, modiﬁed by\n\nimbalances in allelic expression generated by regulatory variants.\n\nWe hypothesized that preferential expression of a gain-of-function\n\nmutation would have a more substantial clinical impact than those\n\noccurring in lowly expressed alleles, thus generating intertumor\n\nclinical heterogeneity (Fig. 2a). To test this, we carried mutant vs.\n\nwild-type allelic expression analysis in breast tumor samples\n\ncarrying somatic PIK3CA missense mutations on two independent\n\nsets of data, the METABRIC (n =94) and the TCGA (n =178)\n\nprojects. Supplementary Table 4 presents a summary description\n\nof the two datasets and Supplementary Fig. 2 shows the number,\n\nlocation, and amino acid alterations of the mutations across the\n\ntwo datasets.\n\nNext, we calculated three allelic ratios from DNA-seq and RNA-\n\nseq data for each mutation:\n\n(1) α ¼ log2 (number of mutant RNA-seq reads/number of wild-\n\ntype RNA-seq reads), i.e., the net mutant allele expression\n\nimbalance;\n\n(2) β ¼ log2 (number of mutant DNA-seq reads/number of\n\nwild-type DNA-seq reads), i.e., the mutant allele relative\n\ncopy-number;\n\n\n(3) γ=α−β, i.e., the net mutant allele expression imbalance\n\nnormalized for the DNA allelic copy-number imbalances,\n\nwhich corresponds to a putative mutant allele expression\n\nimbalance due to cis-regulation.\n\nIn this way, α reports on the net allelic expression imbalance,\n\ngenerated by different mechanisms including copy-number\n\naberrations, cellularity differences, and cis-regulatory variation,\n\nwhile γ reports speciﬁcally on the contribution from cis-regulatory\n\nvariation (rVar in Fig. 2a), including normal genetic variation,\n\nsomatic noncoding mutations, and allelic epigenetic changes.\n\nFigure 2b displays the distributions of the different ratios.\n\nWe found that net mutant allele expression imbalances (α ratio)\n\nare frequent in breast tumors, at 70.2% in METABRIC (66 out of 94)\n\nand 60.1% in TCGA (107 out of 178). The same is true for γ ratios,\n\nat 27.7% for METABRIC (26 out of 94) and 11.8% for TCGA (21 out\n\nof 178), indicating that cis-regulatory effects acting on mutations\n\nare also frequent in breast tumors. In both sets, we found samples\n\nwith striking net preferential allelic expression for the mutant\n\nallele (maximum 44.8-fold and 220-fold in METABRIC and TCGA,\n\nrespectively), but not so for the preferential expression of the wild-\n\ntype allele (fold differences of 5.4 and 29 in METABRIC and TCGA,\n\nrespectively) (Fig. 2b). Similarly, the mutant allele’s most\n\npronounced preferential expression trend was found for the γ\n\nratio, 10- and 4.2-fold for METABRIC and TCGA, respectively, albeit\n\nwith smaller fold differences between alleles.\n\nInterestingly, we observed that within the samples with\n\nsigniﬁcant mutant allele expression imbalance due to cis-\n\nregulatory variation there was a signiﬁcant prevalence of samples\n\nthat preferentially expressed the mutated allele in both datasets\n\n(binomial test Prob. =1, 89%−CI =[0.89, 1.00], P =3 × 10−8 for\n\nMETABRIC and Prob. =0.90, 89%−CI =[0.73, 0.98], P =2 × 10−4\n\nfor TCGA).\n\n\nCis-regulatory variants contribute signiﬁcantly to imbalances\n\nin the expression of mutant alleles\n\nNext, hypothesizing that both copy number and cis-regulatory\n\nvariants are the major contributors to allelic expression, we set out\n\nto assess the contribution of each mechanism toward the net\n\nmutant allele expression imbalances detected in these tumors.\n\nFirst, we found positive correlations between net allelic expression\n\nand both copy number and cis-regulatory variation (Fig. 2c), albeit\n\nwith an effect for the copy number over the double the size of\n\nthat found for cis-regulatory variation (average Pearson correlation\n\nr2 =0.80 and 0.34, respectively). Next, we considered the variance\n\n(Var) of the net allelic expression as the sum of the effects of both\n\nmechanisms, plus the covariance (Cov) accounting for predicted\n\nnon-mutual exclusion of mechanisms acting on any given allele:\n\nVarðαÞ ¼ VarðβÞ þ VarðγÞ þ 2 Covðβ; γÞ; (1)\n\nwe calculated the contribution of cis-regulatory variation to the\n\nvariance of net allelic expression as ðVarðγÞ þ Covðβ; γÞÞ=VarðαÞ.\n\nHere, we found that cis-regulatory variants explain 20.6% and\n\n14.4% of the variability of net mutant allelic expression seen in\n\nMETABRIC and TCGA, respectively (Supplementary Table 5).\n\nFinally, assessing how the two mechanisms act simultaneously\n\non each tumor, we found that the majority of samples (70.2% and\n\n54.5% for the METABRIC and TCGA, respectively) had positive γ\n\nand negative β values (Fig. 2d), suggesting that although the\n\nmutant allele was in lower genomic quantity, it was nevertheless\n\npreferentially expressed compared to the wild-type allele. Inter-\n\nestingly, there were 10.6% and 11.2% samples with positive α and\n\nnegative β values, in METABRIC and TCGA respectively. This shows\n\nthat these tumors overexpress the mutant allele despite this allele\n\nbeing in lower copy number.\n\n\nPreferential expression of mutant alleles by cis-regulatory variation associates with poor prognosis\n\nTo investigate the impact of differential cis-regulation of PIK3CA’s\n\nmutations on clinical outcome (overall and disease-speciﬁc\n\nsurvival), we performed univariate survival analysis with γ ratios\n\ncategorized in three groups, based on the existence of imbalance\n\nand its direction, i.e. whether there was signiﬁcant predominance of\n\nexpression of the mutated allele γmut, of the wild-type allele γwt, or\n\nbalanced allelic expression γbalanced. We uncovered that the group\n\nγmut had a poorer disease-speciﬁc survival rate (P =0.031, Fig. 3a)\n\n\n\nthan the γbalanced group for METABRIC. The median overall survival\n\nfor the γmut group was 5.88 years and for the γbalanced group was\n\n12.46 years (Supplementary Fig. 4B), whereas, in the disease-\n\nspeciﬁc analysis, the mean survival of the γmut patients was 7.07\n\nyears, and 41% of patients died during the length of the follow-up,\n\nin comparison with 25.3% deaths in the γbalanced group (Fig. 3a).\n\nThe categorized γ ratios were not signiﬁcantly associated with\n\noverall survival in the multivariate analysis (Supplementary Fig. 5).\n\nHowever, some of the variables that are usually independent\n\nprognosis factors, such as PR and HER2 statuses, were not\n\nsigniﬁcantly associated with survival either in this analysis. In the\n\nTCGA set, there was a trend toward a worse disease-speciﬁc\n\nsurvival of those patients whose tumors preferentially express the\n\nmutated allele (Supplementary Fig. 6). However, due to the\n\nrelatively shorter follow-up time of this dataset (median ~1 year)\n\nand the fact that tumors were mainly Luminal A (~61.2% of\n\nsamples)18, the power to detect signiﬁcant differences is smaller\n\nthan that of METABRIC. Nevertheless, the joint analysis of the two\n\ndatasets showed a signiﬁcantly worse disease-speciﬁc survival of\n\nthe αmut group of patients, with a concordant trend in the γmut\n\ngroup (Supplementary Fig. 7).\n\n\nPIK3CA preferential mutant allele expression associates with\n\nclinicopathological variables\n\nNext, we sought to investigate whether PIK3CA’s differential\n\nmutant allele was associated with known prognostic clinicopatho-\n\nlogical variables, namely hormone receptors (ER, PR) and HER2\n\nampliﬁcation, which are directly and indirectly connected to gene\n\nexpression regulation, respectively.\n\nFor both datasets, we observed that preferential mutant allele\n\nexpression driven by cis-regulatory variation (γ) was associated\n\nwith markers of worse prognosis, namely it was signiﬁcantly\n\nhigher in ER-negative tumors and PR-negative tumors, and in\n\nHER2-positive tumors only in METABRIC (Fig. 3b). When evaluating\n\nthe contribution of cis-regulatory variation to this association, we\n\nalso found that higher average γ values associated with lower PR\n\nexpression (P =0.040) and HER2-positive tumors (P =0.025), but\n\nwe did not ﬁnd a signiﬁcant association with ER expression\n\n(P =0.129) (Supplementary Fig. 8).\n\nGiven these results, we took γ into consideration in the survival\n\nanalysis within the expression subgroups of ER, PR, and HER2, but\n\ndid not ﬁnd signiﬁcant differences in overall and disease-speciﬁc\n\nsurvival in METABRIC (Supplementary Fig. 4).\n\nConsidering other known prognostic variables, including\n\ntumor size, grade, and molecular subtypes (PAM5019 and\n\nIntClust14, we found a signiﬁcant association between γ ratios\n\nand PAM50 subtypes only in METABRIC (q =0.027) (Supplemen-\n\ntary Table 6 and Supplementary Fig. 9).\n\nFinally, we did not ﬁnd an association between the candidate\n\ngermline regulatory variant rs2699887 and γ or clinical out-\n\ncome, suggesting germline variants are unlikely to be involved in\n\nthe signiﬁcant associations described above (data not shown).\n\nHowever, supporting the involvement of somatic cis-regulatory\n\nvariants instead, we found smaller fold changes and less samples\n\nwith imbalances measured at common PIK3CA variants in normal-\n\nmatched tissue data than those measured at mutations in tumor\n\ntissue (Supplementary Fig. 10).",

      "section_content": "Our work reveals the role of cis-regulatory variation acting on\n\nPIK3CA somatic mutations as modiﬁers of mutation penetrance.\n\nWe show for the ﬁrst time that allelic expression imbalance\n\nbetween PIK3CA’s mutant and wild-type alleles is common and\n\nprognostic in breast cancer.\n\nParticularly, preferential expression of the mutant allele is\n\nsigniﬁcantly more common than that of the wild-type allele, and considering that PIK3CA is an oncogene, one possibility is that\n\npositive selection could have a role in generating this difference,\n\nwhich should be further investigated. Furthermore, we also\n\nfound that allelic imbalance in expression observed for the\n\nmutant alleles in the tumors was greater than that observed for\n\nsingle-nucleotide polymorphisms in the normal-matched tissue\n\nof patients. These ﬁndings support the hypothesis of somatic\n\nregulatory mutations involvement in generating the imbalances\n\nobserved in the tumors. While genomic allelic imbalance remains\n\nthe largest determinant of allelic expression dosage (showing the\n\nhighest correlation with and contributing the most to the\n\nvariability observed in net allelic expression), cis-regulatory\n\nvariation is also signiﬁcantly correlated with net allelic expression\n\nand explains ~16% of its variability across samples in these sets\n\nof tumors.\n\nThe analysis of RNA-seq data from two independent cohorts of\n\ntumor samples, the METABRIC and TCGA projects, strongly\n\nsupports our ﬁndings.\n\nMoreover, we show that preferential expression of the mutant\n\nallele due to cis-variation is associated with poor prognosis\n\nvariables, such as ER-negative, PR-negative, and Her2-positive\n\nstatuses20,21. In the METABRIC dataset, we also found that\n\npreferential expression of the mutant allele was associated with\n\nworse overall and disease-speciﬁc survival. The high stringency\n\nin calling imbalance and the focus on a speciﬁc type of mutation\n\nin one gene, limits this study in terms of the sample size\n\nanalyzed, but on the other hand it provides the simplest scenario\n\nfor testing our hypothesis. Interestingly, the joint analysis of the\n\ndatasets revealed some level of association between disease-\n\nspeciﬁc survival and the preferential expression of the mutant\n\nallele, both net and due to cis-regulation, reafﬁrming the clinical\n\nimportance of the expression level of a mutation commonly\n\nassociated with aggressive tumors. In addition, some tumors\n\npresented preferential expression of the wild-type allele of\n\nPIK3CA, suggesting that these mutations are lowly expressed and\n\npossibly passenger events.\n\nBesides the potential use of our ﬁndings as a prognosis\n\nbiomarker in the clinic, these results may also have therapeutic\n\nimplications. Some of the major clinical challenges in cancer\n\ntreatment are identifying biomarkers of prognosis and deﬁning\n\nwhich patients will beneﬁt from a given therapy. Particularly, it is\n\ncrucial to identify patients unlikely to respond to speciﬁc therapies\n\nto prevent unnecessary drug cytotoxicity without any therapeutic\n\nbeneﬁts. Our results reveal the importance of considering allelic\n\nexpression in somatic mutation screens in these two aspects of\n\npatient management. Despite the high frequency of PIK3CA\n\nmutations in breast cancers, the response to PI3K inhibitor therapy\n\nhas been more challenging than expected, and the prognostic\n\nsigniﬁcance of detecting somatic PIK3CA mutations in breast\n\ntumors is unclear22. Relevant to this discussion, we have\n\npreviously shown that the presence of PIK3CA mutations confer\n\na poorer prognosis in patients with ER-positive breast cancer\n\nonly when stratiﬁed into copy-number driven subgroups (IntClust\n\n1+, 2+, 9+)23.\n\nIn this study, we provide new evidence for the prognostic\n\nsigniﬁcance of these mutations at the expression level in breast\n\ntumors. Particularly for tumors with signiﬁcant preferential\n\nexpression of the wild-type allele, this prognostic signiﬁcance\n\nhas a potential impact on therapy response and clinical manage-\n\nment since one may hypothesize that little to no beneﬁt would\n\ncome from treatment in the cases not expressing the targetable\n\nmutation.\n\nFurther studies evaluating the allelic expression of mutant\n\noncogenes in the tumors of patients enrolled in molecular-driven\n\ntrials will clarify this impact.\n\nMore challenging is determining which cis-regulatory mechan-\n\nisms are promoting allelic expression imbalances. Both inherited11,2 manner28,29.\n\nHere we show that normal cis-regulatory variation regulates\n\nPIK3CA’s expression in normal breast tissue, with the possible\n\ncontribution of rs2699887as a regulatory variant. We also found\n\nthat the heterozygotes for “rs2699887” were associated with\n\nhigher expression of the PIK3CA gene compared to the common\n\nhomozygotes. Although there is published data supporting the\n\nclinical association of rs2699887 with poor prognosis in other\n\ncancers30,31, linked to an increase in PI3K signaling, there is still\n\nsome data supporting the opposite association32,33. We did not\n\nﬁnd an association between rs2699887 and survival, which\n\nopens the possibility for other mechanisms besides normal cis-\n\nregulatory variation to be considered as contributors to the\n\npreferential allelic expression in these tumors (data not shown).\n\nDouble PIK3CA mutations in the same allele are frequent in\n\nbreast tumors34, and the impact of noncoding mutations in cancer\n\nis just starting to be explored6. So, a possibility is that the\n\ncombination of noncoding and coding mutations in the same\n\ngene might be underlying the allelic expression imbalances we\n\nare detecting.\n\nFurther studies on allelic expression imbalances of activating\n\nmutations, and even inactivating ones, should further reveal the\n\ncontribution of cis-regulatory mechanisms in tumor develop-\n\nment and progression. Particularly interesting to determine is\n\nwhether the coding mutation originates in an allele predis-\n\nposed with higher expression, or whether a sequence of\n\nsomatic events introduces the coding activating mutation and\n\nadditional cis-regulatory noncoding mutations. The answers\n\ncould have signiﬁcant repercussions on our understanding of\n\ntumor evolution.\n\nIn summary, we show that differential expression between the\n\nmutant and wild-type alleles of PIK3CA is common in breast cancer\n\nand with a signiﬁcant contribution from allele-speciﬁc cis-\n\nregulatory effects. We further show that mutant allele differential\n\nexpression is associated with clinical parameters such as ER, PR,\n\nand HER2 statuses and is prognostically signiﬁcant.\n\nCollectively, our work establishes the prognostic relevance of\n\nallele-speciﬁc transcriptional regulation of PIK3CA somatic muta-\n\ntions. It also supports a shift in the mutation testing in patient\n\nmanagement, where the level of expression of these mutations\n\nshould be considered, besides the detection at the DNA level.",

The median overall survival for the γmut group was 5.88 years and for the γbalanced group was 12.46 years (Supplementary Fig. 4B), whereas, in the disease-speciﬁc analysis, the mean survival of the γmut patients was 7.07 years, and 41% of patients died during the length of the follow-up, in comparison with 25.3% deaths in the γbalanced group (Fig. 3a). The categorized γ ratios were not signiﬁcantly associated with overall survival in the multivariate analysis (Supplementary Fig. 5). However, some of the variables that are usually independent prognosis factors, such as PR and HER2 statuses, were not signiﬁcantly associated with survival either in this analysis. In the TCGA set, there was a trend toward a worse disease-speciﬁc survival of those patients whose tumors preferentially express the mutated allele (Supplementary Fig. 6). However, due to the relatively shorter follow-up time of this dataset (median ~1 year) and the fact that tumors were mainly Luminal A (~61.2% of samples)18, the power to detect signiﬁcant differences is smaller than that of METABRIC. Nevertheless, the joint analysis of the two datasets showed a signiﬁcantly worse disease-speciﬁc survival of the αmut group of patients, with a concordant trend in the γmut group (Supplementary Fig. 7).",

When evaluating\n\nthe contribution of cis‐regulatory variation to this association, we\n\nalso found that higher average γ values associated with lower PR\n\nexpression (P =0.040) and HER2-positive tumors (P =0.025), but\n\nwe did not ﬁnd a signiﬁcant association with ER expression\n\n(P =0.129) (Supplementary Fig. 8).\n\nGiven these results, we took γ into consideration in the survival\n\nanalysis within the expression subgroups of ER, PR, and HER2, but\n\ndid not ﬁnd signiﬁcant differences in overall and disease-speciﬁc\n\nsurvival in METABRIC (Supplementary Fig. 4).\n\nConsidering other known prognostic variables, including\n\ntumor size, grade, and molecular subtypes (PAM5019 and\n\nIntClust14, we found a signiﬁcant association between γ ratios\n\nand PAM50 subtypes only in METABRIC (q =0.027) (Supplemen-\n\ntary Table 6 and Supplementary Fig. 9).\n\nFinally, we did not ﬁnd an association between the candidate\n\ngermline regulatory variant rs2699887 and γ or clinical out-\n\ncome, suggesting germline variants are unlikely to be involved in\n\nthe signiﬁcant associations described above (data not shown).\n\nHowever, supporting the involvement of somatic cis‐regulatory\n\nvariants instead, we found smaller fold changes and less samples\n\nwith imbalances measured at common PIK3CA variants in normal-\n\nmatched tissue data than those measured at mutations in tumor\n\ntissue (Supplementary Fig. 10).",
