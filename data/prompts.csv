You have supervised the writing of several scientific papers. You have also reviewed submitted papers to prestiguous science magazines.

The following text belongs to a scientific paper. It contains statements along with references. Your job is to identify those statements and the references. The output will be a json file that is an array of objects, each object containing two properties:

property statement: the statement, which would be verbatim from the original text, either a sentence or part of a sentence
property statement_full: the statement explained with all the necessary contextt to clarify the claim, so anyone that reads it and understand it without the need of reading the rest of the paper
property references_verbatim: the references, an array with references that are verbatim from the original text
property references_consistent: the references, an array with references that are corrected If needed) from the original text, and that will be identical if the same reference appears associated with other statement

Only identify statements that have references.

TASK:

Your task is to identify the paper sections and parsing them according to the rules.

Parsing rules:
1. A section begins when a line starts with its name (case-insensitive) or any
   of these synonyms:

      Abstract      →  Summary, Overview
      Introduction  →  Background
      Results       →  Findings, Results and Discussion
      Discussion    →  Analysis
      Other         →  Any text not belonging to the four main sections

2. If a heading contains “and” (e.g. “Results and Discussion”), split it and
   assign the first part to Results and the second to Discussion.

3. A section ends at the next recognised heading.

4. Preserve original paragraph breaks; strip page headers / footers.

5. If a section is missing, omit its object.  
   Use the “Other” section only for text that appears *before the first* or
   *after the last* recognised heading.

Here is the paper to parse:

<BEGIN_PAPER>
[paper_content]
<END_PAPER>

The JSON must be an ARRAY of objects; each object has exactly two keys:
[
  {
    ""section_name"":   ""<Abstract | Introduction | Results | Discussion | Other>"",
    ""section_content"": ""<verbatim text of that section>""

TASK:

Your task is to :

1) Identify the Subresult sections within the Results text.

Follow the guidelines:

*Identify Subresult Boundaries:*

TITLE:
1. Each subresult block begins with a main title """"""subresult title verbatim"""""". 
2. Sometimes, multiple related subresult blocks are under the same title: In this case attribute sequential """"""subresult_numbers"""""" and mantain the sabe  """"""verbatim text of that section"""""".

Titles are typically concise, capturing the main takeaway or insight clearly and explicitly.

SUBRESULT:
Each title sould be followed by narrative triplets:
- question of the experiment (why the author did?, what did they want to find out?), 
- method approach (How did the author solve the problem? Experimental comparisons, groups, techniques, etc).
- result (what did they find out?)

The sequence order might change.

You evaluate answers **one question at a time** and must never suggest content that belongs to any other question.

HARD CONSTRAINTS  
• Focus only on scientific clarity, completeness, and accuracy for the current question.  
• No feedback on grammar, style, or formatting.  
• Allowed categories: absence of information, lack of clarity, incomplete content, off-scope content.  
• Use high scores (8–10) only for truly critical problems.

HIGH-LEVEL TASK  
Provide balanced, actionable feedback on the author’s answer, or confirm it is complete.

1. Read the QUESTION, GUIDELINES, optional EXAMPLE, and AUTHOR_ANSWER.  
2. Compare AUTHOR_ANSWER strictly to the current QUESTION + GUIDELINES and EXAMPLE if available.  
3. Identify if there are up to 5 meaningful issues (missing info, unclear logic, off-scope content, etc.).

SCORING GUIDE  
• **9–10 (Critical)** – The answer fails its purpose: essential content absent, factually wrong, or severely unclear; must be rewritten.  
  Example: Gap section gives no explicit gap; Aim section lacks a research question.  
• **7–8 (Important)** – Major weakness: core point present but incomplete or ambiguous; fixing greatly improves the answer.  
  Example: Key statistic or citation missing; Background lists studies without synthesis.  
• **5–6 (Useful)** – Moderate issue: answer acceptable but could be clearer, better supported, or more precise.  
  Example: Some citations missing; minor logical jump.  
• **3–4 (Minor)** – Small, optional improvement.  
  Example: Re-order bullets for flow; clarify an acronym.  
• **1–2 (Trivial)** – Very minor suggestion; low priority.  
  Example: Shorten one phrase.
• **No problem was found. The answer is complete!
