",3,2,6,"Pancreatic cancer is a relatively rare form of cancer, with a life-time risk of developing pancreatic cancer of 1 in 76. 
Due to the high fatality rate, however, it is the fourth highest in absolute numbers of fatalities (Siegel et al., 2016). 
One of the major reasons for the high mortality is the late detection of pancreatic cancer and poor therapeutic options. This gives a median survival of <6 months and a 5-year survival rate of <8% (Cleary et al., 2004).","Transposable elements are DNA segments capable of moving between different locations[1]
They are widespread across all domains of life and have significantly affected genome diversity and evolution[2].

Some mobile elements are also emerging as potential biotechnological and gene editing tools[5]
","Transgenesis in plants is widely used to both generate research tools and engineer crop improvement[13].
Traditional transgene integration occurs at random locations in the plant genome[14], which can generate unintended mutations and subject the expression of the transgene to undesired position effects[15]

1. Purpose

Create a narrative that moves from broad, established knowledge to the specific research context, so readers can understand why the forthcoming gap exists.• State the landmark findings and recent advances that the reader needs to know to understand the study.• Show limitations, conflicts, or missing data that lead directly to the gap (But the gap itself will be stated later).

2. Fidelity to Author Content

• Use the author-supplied information with maximum rigor—no invention of facts or citations.• You may re-order, compress, or paraphrase only to improve clarity and narrative flow; never distort meaning.• Every reference provided by the author must appear in the output. Preserve citation style (author–year or numbered) exactly as given.

3. Absolute Prohibitions

• No introductory, concluding, or summarising sentences beyond the substantive background narrative.

• No invention of facts or references.• Do not mention “this study,” the methods, or results.

4. Structure – “Funnel Shape”

Broad context opening– Begin with a direct statement of widely accepted information about the topic (no lead-in phrases).

**Thematic synthesis of prior work**– Group studies by theme; link them with phrases such as “collectively,” “together,” “however.”– Highlight consensus first, then narrow to unresolved or contested points.

Limitations / conflicts / missing data– If available in the authors notes, Briefly note methodological flaws, small samples, contradictory findings, or unknowns that set up the forthcoming gap.

Lead-in to the gap– End with a sentence that naturally positions the reader to hear the explicit gap next.

5. Writing Rules

• Use present tense, active voice where feasible (“studies show…”, “evidence remains conflicting…”).• Define acronyms or specialised terms the first time they appear.• No word-limit applies—write as long as needed for clarity.

6. Quality-Control Checklist

✔ Only author-supplied facts and citations?✔ Direct broad-to-specific flow without extra intro/outro lines?✔ All author citations included and correctly placed?✔ Active-voice sentences with logical transitions?✔ Final sentence leads into the gap but does not state it yet?

Traditional transgene integration occurs at random locations in the plant genome[14], which can generate unintended mutations and subject the expression of the transgene to undesired position effects[15],[16].
Sequence-specific target-site integration of transgenes is highly desired and has been attempted in plants for over a decade (reviewed previously[1]). 
Although there has been progress[17],[18], the low efficiency and quality of current target-site integration technologies hampers crop genome engineering[2].
Several approaches have been taken in plants to insert transgenic sequences into specific genomic locations[17],[18],[19]. 
Homologous recombination (HR) in plants has been demonstrated, but the rate is extremely low and it is therefore not used[20]. 
Programmable nuclease systems that create sequence-specific DNA breaks, such as CRISPR–Cas9, have improved targeted integration[1]. 
Prime editing techniques in plants enable the insertion of small sequences up to 34 base pairs (bp) at a targeted site[21], but larger insertions are required to encode new extrinsic traits[22]. 
Homology-directed repair (HDR) can integrate new DNA through the resolution of induced double-stranded DNA breaks by recombination with a supplied DNA sequence that matches both flanks of the cleaved DNA[23]. 
HDR occurs at a low frequency in plants as the repair of the DNA breaks occurs primarily by non-homologous end joining (NHEJ), which can include the integration of random fragments of DNA[24]. 
The preference for NHEJ repair in plants has been taken advantage of to knock-in supplied extrachromosomal DNA during the repair of a CRISPR-induced double-stranded break[25],[26].
HDR and NHEJ knock-ins are frequently subject to deletions of the flanking target-site DNA and/or the sequence that was delivered (the cargo)[17],[27]. 
Owing to the low integration frequency and high deletion rate, these approaches involve the expensive production of many transgenic plants followed by laborious screening for a rare intact targeted integration event.",,,,,

How to Write:

- Articulate what remains not known or less explored in the field of study by pinpointing the specific knowledge lack the research aims to address.
- When pertinent, start the gap unit with words similar to  “However” to effectively highlight the contrast between what is known (impact and background units) and what is yet to be discovered or understood. 
- When that information is available in the answer unknown, you may build the gap unit by highlighting the limitations or shortcomings of previous research in the field stated in the unknown.  This can be done by pointing out areas where data is lacking, where findings are controversial, or where more information is needed.
- Write the gap unit with a sense of tension or urgency.  This tension drives the narrative forward and highlights the need for your study to address these specific issues or areas of uncertainty.
- You are not obliged to keep the order of information provided by the author. Instead, optimize the sequence of information for clarity and narrative flow.

",6,7,8,"Susceptibility to pancreatic cancer in humans is associated with diet, obesity, and T2D, creating a complex web of interconnections that are difficult to dissect using epidemiological data. To disentangle the effect of obesity and T2D from diet, we intercrossed the db/db and ob/ob mouse strains with the well-characterized TAg transgenic model of pancreatic acinar carcinoma. These strains reflect a genetic form of human obesity, which, while rare, allows the decoupling of qualitative and quantitative dietary changes. ","Having established obesity or total calorie intake as an independent driver of pancreatic acinar carcinoma, we sought to test the independent impact of dietary components. We investigated the effect of dietary protein by placing breeder cages on either control or high-protein diets and continuing the dietary manipulation after weaning, in effect manipulating dietary exposure from the in utero stage onward.","Using the same system of dietary change from the in utero stage onward, we investigated the effect of increased dietary fat. TAg+ mice were exposed to either 10% or 30% dietary fat
and compared to the control diet through longitudinal MRI assessment.","As dietary sugars have been linked to obesity and T2D, risk factors for pancreatic cancer, we tested the effect of simple dietary sugars on tumor kinetics. We compared tumor growth in mice fed the control diet versus either a sugar-free or a high-glucose diet (Figure S2).","In the human context, studying the effect of diet on pancreatic cancer is problematic. As a disease with late detection and an effect on patient appetite, prospective studies are essential for the causal dissection of disease drivers. Few population studies are, however, sufficiently powered to study such a rare cancer. We therefore turned to the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC) study, an ongoing prospective cohort designed to investigate the relationships between diet, lifestyle, and environmental factors on cancer and other chronic diseases. More than half a million participants were enrolled in 23 centers across 10 European countries from 1992 to 2000. Epidemiological information was collected at the time of recruitment and included medical history, anthropometric measures, and lifestyle and dietary characteristics, with ongoing follow-up for cancer outcomes. For the current analysis, epidemiologic data were available for 465,076 individuals, 1,344 individuals of which
had developed pancreatic cancer during the follow-up period. Using a multivariable Cox proportional hazards model and taking into account smoking status, body mass index (BMI), age, diabetes, and sex, we evaluated the effects of eight dietary components on the risk of pancreatic cancer. The only significant effect observed was a retrotective effect of dietary plant fat, with a hazard ratio of 0.9926 (Table S1), which translates to a 0.74% decrease in the risk of pancreatic cancer development per
gram increase in daily plant fat consumption. This effect was largely unchanged following control for by diabetes, smoking, BMI, age at recruitment, or sex (see Data Resource on Mendeley Data in STAR Methods). We investigated genotype-dependent dietary effects through integrating nutritional information with genotype information for 5,726 individuals comprising 465 pancreatic cancer cases and 5,261 controls. A genome-wide gene 3 environment (GxE) interaction analysis was conducted to detect interactions between dietary factors and genotype on pancreatic cancer susceptibility (Figure S8).",

""Despite being fed a low-sugar diet, both TAg+ db/db and TAg+ ob/ob mice developed severe and early onset obesity (Figures S1A–S1F); however, only the TAg+ db/db mice
also developed diabetes (Figures S1G–S1L). From 7 weeks of age onward, TAg+ , TAg+ db/db, and TAg+ ob/ob mice were scanned by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for the presence
and size of pancreatic tumors (Figures S1M–S1Z). The cumulative incidence of pancreatic tumors in these mice demonstrated that both the db/db and ob/ob genotypes significantly hastened
tumor onset (Figures 1A and 1B), resulting in tumor development 5 weeks earlier than that observed in non-obese TAg+ mice (Figure 1C). Both the db/db and ob/ob genotypes trended toward an
increased tumor growth rate (Figure 1D). For both female and male mice, obesity resulted in elevated mortality due to pancreatic cancer, with a high level of death observed at 14 weeks in
both db/db and ob/ob strains, while substantial mortality was delayed out past 21 weeks in the non-obese TAg+ mice (Figures 1E and 1F). Even after normalizing for the earlier development,
db/db and ob/ob mice still showed significantly higher levels of tumor-associated mortality (Figures 1G and 1H). ""

",gpt41,,"the segment of the sub-results that tells the results founded in that sub-section. It should highlight trends, patterns and unexpected results. ",3,7,8,"TAg+ mice, on either the control or high-protein diet, were then assessed by MRI every 2 weeks for the presence and size of pancreatic tumors (Figure S2). We assessed the effect of altered dietary protein on pancreatic cancer development (Figures 2A and 2B). Female mice raised on a high-protein diet exhibited a 2-week delay in pancreatic cancer onset (Figures 2A and 2C). No significant effect was observed in male mice (Figure 2B); this was due to the statistical limitations of pairwise dietary effects rather than sex-specific dietary effects, as a nutritional landscape analysis demonstrated similar effects of dietary protein on male and female mice (see below). Overall, no significant effect was seen on the tumor growth rate (Figure 2D) at the macroscopic level; however, a substantial drop in tumor proliferation was observed in both sexes through histology (Figures 2E and 2F). Using RNA sequencing (RNA-seq), we profiled the transcriptome of size-matched tumors from high-protein and control diets. Pathway analysis (Figure 2G) identified a strong downregulation of cell-cycle-associated genes (Figures 2H and S3A) and ribosome components (Figures 2I and S3B). At the molecular level, the high-protein diet is therefore associated with a stalling of the cell cycle and a reduction in biomass synthesis capacity, explaining the macro-level phenotype observed.

Tumor-induced mortality was unchanged (Figures S4C and S4D), although the duration of observation was not sensitized for detecting decreased mortality.","Through cumulative pancreatic cancer incidence, there was no effect of increased dietary fat on female mice (Figure 3A) and only a minor acceleration of incidence in male mice fed 30% fat (Figures 3B and 3C). Analysis of the effect of dietary fat on pancreatic cancer growth rates indicated no systematic effect (Figure 3D). At a histological level, no changes were observed in tumor morphology, cellular density, or proliferation (Figures 3E–3G). Despite the lack of any substantial effects on the tumor itself, a high-fat diet had a profound effect on the mortality rate of tumor-bearing male (Figure 3H) but not female (Figure 3I) mice. Male TAg+ mice fed either the 10% or the 30% fat died on average 7 weeks earlier than control-fed mice, despite similar tumor burdens. Notably, these effects were observed before any major changes in body weight (Figure S4), indicating that the diet, rather than obesity, was the causative factor. This toxicity effect could not be explained at the molecular level, with few coordinated transcriptional or metabolic changes in tumors from mice fed 30% fat compared to the control diet revealed by RNA-seq analysis (Figure 3J).","Analysis of cumulative incidence of pancreatic cancer found no significant effect of high-glucose relative to the (sugar-containing) control diet; however, there was a significant delay in tumor development of 5 weeks in mice fed sugar-free diets (Figures 4A–4C). A nutritional landscape analysis, however, identified this effect as tracking with the elevated protein composition of the sugar-free diet (see below), demonstrating the complexity of a multifactorial nutritional analysis. Analysis of tumor growth rates found a trend toward higher sugar levels’ driving more rapid tumor expansion (Figure 4D). At the histological level, a clear dose-dependent effect of the glucose content of the diet on tumor cell proliferation and density was observed (Figures 4E–4G). A large effect of sugar was also observed on tumor-induced mortality, with high-glucose diets driving early-onset mortality (Figures 4H and 4I), and the sugar-free diet significantly delaying mortality in female mice (Figure 4I). At a transcriptional level, the tumors from high-glucose-fed mice exhibited an elevated expression of cell-cycle genes and ribosome components compared to sugar-free-fed mice (Figures 4J and S5). Metabolic profiling revealed a reduction in amino acid levels in the tumors from high-glucose-fed mice (Figure 4K), possibly indicating that amino acids were actively used for protein synthesis. We then tested the association between blood glucose level and upregulation of the cell-cycle signature within the tumor. Across the range of diets used in this study, mice with higher blood glucose levels showed a tendency toward high expression of the cell-cycle signature (Figure 4L).","Through MRI monitoring (Figure S6), no significant effect of additional sugar was observed on the cumulative incidence and age of tu-
mor onset (Figures 5A and 5B). The determination of growth rates likewise indicated no effect of additional sugars on tumor growth (Figure 5C). However, the addition of glucose, but not fructose or sucrose, substantially increased the tumor-induced mortality (Figure 5D). These results suggest two major roles of dietary sugar on pancreatic cancer. First, sugar starvation is associated with a delay in the onset and a reduction in growth of the cancer (Figure 4). Second, excessive glucose, and not the other sugars tested, is associated with an increase in the lethality of the cancer (Figure 5D). To determine whether these two properties are linked, we aged female TAg+ mice, which demonstrated the strongest protection of a sugar-free diet (Figure 4H), on the control diet during longitudinal MRI assessment. 
At the point of first tumor detection, we switched a subset of these mice to the sugar-free diet and monitored pancreatic cancer growth. The switch to a sugar-free diet after first tumor detection delayed the growth of the tumors in female mice, similar to the growth levels observed in mice continuously on a sugar-free diet (Figure 5E). By contrast, while female mice continually on a sugar-free diet show no tumor-induced mortality within the observation period, mice switched onto a sugar-free diet at tumor detection maintained the high level of mortality associated with control-diet mice (Figure 5F).","A total of 5 loci reached p values of %107 for their effect on pancreatic cancer susceptibility given the sugar intake (Table 1). One locus, at LINC01365 neighboring the MAD2L1 gene (Table 1) and within a regulatory region linked to MAD2L1 expression (Figure S9), reached a p value of 7.3 3 108 for GxE with sugar intake. An interaction between sugar intake and MAD2L1 expression is supported through our transcriptional analysis of murine tumors, in which dietary glucose levels were positively associated with the regulation of Mad2l1 expression in the tumor (Figure 6F). We also observed one locus modifying the previously identified effect of plant fat consumption on pancreatic cancer risk (p < 105). The top locus, DIRC3, had a pvalue of 3.07 3 106 (Table 1; Figure S10). We further evaluated these loci with credible set analysis Fuchsberger et al., 2016). We constructed credible sets of variants that contain the variant causal for the corresponding association signal with R99% probability.",

By contrast, in this model, there was no additional effect of T2D, with no significant differences between the obese and diabetic db/db mice and the obese non-diabetic ob/ob strain.","These results indicate tumor-suppressant effects of the high-protein diet on pancreatic acinar carcinoma. While this result could be interpreted as a suppressive effect of dietary protein, shifts in the alternative macro-molecule composition and total calorie intake (13% reduced in
the high-protein diet mice compared to the control diet mice) may also contribute to the effect observed.","These results suggest that while dietary fat has little or mild direct pro-oncogenic properties, the high-fat diets have a major effect on tumor-induced mortality in male mice. While this effect could be a direct result of the dietary fat, high-fat diets also had elevated dietary sugars and increased energy density, suggestive of alternative sources of the effect.","These data indicate that dietary sugar (or downstream mediators, such as insulin) enhances the cell cycle and upregulates the ribosomal capacity, feeding the proliferation and pathogenicity of pancreatic acinar carcinoma.","These results are consistent with a model of dietary sugar in which the effect on lethality is programmed in at the point of tumor develop-
ment, while the effect on tumor growth is a continuous property.",

The first is that pancreatic cancer onset, growth, and lethality can be modulated via independent forces, rather than being inherently linked characteristics. A reasonable supposition could have been made that pancreatic cancer lethality was simply derived from tumor growth rates; here, however, we identify multiple contexts (high-fat diet, dietary sugar withdrawal) in which these effects were disentangled. The second key principle is that both quantitative and qualitative effects of diet were observed, with a distinct modulation of pancreatic cancer by calorie quantity (obesity) and source (nutrient composition).

",5,6,7,"The function of sugar, in particular glucose, in increasing the rate of tumor growth is potentially explained by the Warburg effect. Unlike the pre-cancerous precursor cells, which typically use the efficient oxidative phosphorylation pathway, most cancer cells use aerobic glycolysis (Vander Heiden et al., 2009). While aerobic glycolysis is less efficient at energy metabolism, it allows the rapid expansion of biomass required for highly proliferative cells and appears to confer other 
important advantages (Kim and Dang, 2006). Under the traditional Warburg model, the dependence of cancer cells on aerobic glycolysis makes glucose availability a limiting factor for energy production, with additional glucose thus allowing more rapid division. An alternative explanation for the Warburg phenomenon is that increased glycolysis is more important for carbon incorporation into the dividing biomass rather than ATP production (Lunt and Vander Heiden, 2011","While insulin secretion was not measured in our study, hyperinsulinemia is a well-known risk factor for pancreatic cancer (Andersen et al., 2017). Identifying the causative direction of this association is problematic; however, genetic reduction in insulin secretion capacity in the KrasG12D mouse model results in a slowing of pancreatic cancer initiation (Zhang et al., 2019).

There are strengths and limitations to both approaches. With the inability to dissect the interacting risk factors from patient data, reliance on animal models is critical to formally separate effects such as obesity versus nutrition. Nevertheless, the limitations of the mouse model used here need to be considered. A multitude of animal models for pancreatic cancer exist (Salomanet al., 2019). The TAg oncogenic driver is relatively crude, although the molecular impact has been well studied, and the disruption of both KRAS and p53, two commonly mutated genes in pancreatic cancer patients (Hidalgo, 2010), results in an aberrations similar to patients (Hobbs et al., 2016). A more important limitation may be the acinar origin of the tumor, which only reflects a minority of patient cases. Of note, the TAg system does model the complexity of tumor composition, with the interaction of genetically heterogeneous cancer cells, cancer stem cells, tumor stroma, and the immune system, a complexity that is generally lost in cell line systems, even after transfer into mice. Epidemiological work in patients overcomes many of the difficulties of animal models. We should note, however, that even the best-designed observational trial will suffer from unaccounted for confounding effects and erroneous data. In particular, nutritional measurement is notoriously different to validate and changes over time. The heterogeneity in pancreatic cancer type and the limitation of looking at a single snapshot of the diet also dilute effect sizes. In this regard, we consider the mouse and epidemiological aspects to synergize, with effects observed across both methodologies that are much more likely to be robustly reproduced.","Drawbacks to TATSI that can be improved in the future include controlling the orientation of mPing insertion (which is currently uncontrolled) and reducing free transpositions. Off-target insertions occur with both prokaryotic CRISPR-associated transposases and similar eukaryotic synthetic systems12,28,29.

","One of the most surprising results from our study was the degree to which the immune
profiles of parents were more similar to one another than to unrelated pairs. This suggests
that a shared environment acts in some way to bring immunoprofiles towards a convergent
equilibria. Within the environment shared by parents, there is a panoply of plausible
biological mechanisms. For example, an individual’s microbiome converges with those that
they live with 32, even including their dogs 33. Individuals in a relationship, rather than just
co-habiting, have a more similar microbiome 34, possibly via direct transmission 35, which
would make the microbial convergence even stronger for parents. Within our study design,
this shared environment also includes a shared vector (the child), the significance of which
requires further investigation. Beyond the bacterial components of the microbiome, close
proximity allows the transmission of viral pathogens, including CMV, which was found to
influence twin concordance in more than half of their immune traits 3. A shared
environment, including, presumably, socio-economic status, will also bring shared
behaviours, a process called spousal concordance: diet (which can also influence gut
microbiome 36), smoking 37, alcohol intake 38, exercise levels and even control of chronic
diseases like hypertension 39 are all likely to be influenced by a partner’s attitudes towards
them. It is fascinating to speculate that partner choice may also influence response to
immunity and immune pathologies. Finally, we also note, but decline to comment further,
that this “parenthood effect” is a far stronger influence on the immune system than acute and untreated gastroenteritis.","Our results, indicating the potential for pancreatic autoimmunity to control tumour growth, suggest that the immune checkpoint inhibitor trials currently underway may exhibit more success as these strategies essentially serve to unleash the latent autoimmunity encoded in the immune system [25].",,,
