If a heading contains \u201cand\u201d (e.g. \u201cResults and Discussion\u201d), split it and\n   assign the first part to Results and the second to Discussion.\n\n3. A section ends at the next recognised heading.\n\n4. Preserve original paragraph breaks; strip page headers \/ footers.\n\n5. If a section is missing, omit its object.  \n   Use the \u201cOther\u201d section only for text that appears *before the first* or\n   *after the last* recognised heading.\n\nHere is the paper to parse:\n\n<BEGIN_PAPER>\n[paper_content]\n<END_PAPER>\n\nThe JSON must be an ARRAY of objects; each object has exactly two keys:\n[\n  {\n    \"section_name\":   \"<Abstract | Introduction | Results | Discussion | Other>\",\n    \"section_content\": \"<verbatim text of that section>\"\n  },\n  \u2026\n]\n\n",
